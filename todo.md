#### Step 8: Init/Bootstrap Command
- [ ] Implement API-to-local sync (reverse direction)
- [ ] Add file generation from API roles
- [ ] Handle conflicts and user prompts
- [ ] Test round-trip compatibility

#### Step 9: Advanced Features
- [ ] Enhanced dry-run reporting with diffs
- [ ] Comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Production readiness improvements

#### Step 10: Build System and Integration
- [ ] Complete Makefile with all targets
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Cross-platform build support
- [ ] Final documentation and security review

### Notes
- Each step should be completed with full TDD approach
- All tests must pass before moving to next step
- Regular integration testing throughout development
- Focus on incremental progress with working software at each step

### Development Principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) - write tests first
- Small, focused commits that build on each other
- No orphaned code - everything must integrate
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Follow Go best practices and conventions
