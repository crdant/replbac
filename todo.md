- [x] Set up basic Makefile and .gitignore

#### Step 2: Configuration Management
- [x] Implement configuration loading from multiple sources
- [x] Add support for environment variables, config files, CLI flags
- [x] Test configuration precedence and validation
- [x] Handle API token management securely

#### Step 3: YAML File Operations
- [x] Implement YAML file reading and parsing
- [x] Add recursive directory traversal
- [x] Build robust error handling for file operations
- [x] Test edge cases and validation

#### Step 4: HTTP Client and API Integration
- [x] Build HTTP client wrapper for Replicated API
- [x] Implement role CRUD operations
- [x] Add proper error handling and types
- [x] Test with mock HTTP server

#### Step 5: Basic CLI Framework
- [x] Set up Cobra CLI framework
- [x] Implement flag parsing and validation
- [x] Add help text and usage information
- [x] Test CLI structure and commands

#### Step 6: Core Sync Logic
- [x] Implement role comparison logic
- [x] Build sync planning and execution
- [x] Add dry-run mode support
- [x] Test various sync scenarios

#### Step 7: Wire Main Command
- [x] Connect all components in main command
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement user feedback and logging
- [ ] Test complete workflows

#### Step 8: Init/Bootstrap Command
- [ ] Implement API-to-local sync (reverse direction)
- [ ] Add file generation from API roles
- [ ] Handle conflicts and user prompts
- [ ] Test round-trip compatibility

#### Step 9: Advanced Features
- [ ] Enhanced dry-run reporting with diffs
- [ ] Comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Production readiness improvements

#### Step 10: Build System and Integration
- [ ] Complete Makefile with all targets
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Cross-platform build support
- [ ] Final documentation and security review

### Notes
- Each step should be completed with full TDD approach
- All tests must pass before moving to next step
- Regular integration testing throughout development
- Focus on incremental progress with working software at each step

### Development Principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) - write tests first
- Small, focused commits that build on each other
- No orphaned code - everything must integrate
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Follow Go best practices and conventions
